If steam starts then disappears, still running but repeatedly clicks like it's trying to open but cant: 
1. Launch Steam from a terminal to get the GUI to load
2. Open Steam Settings 
3. Choose Interface
4. Uncheck "Enable GPU accelerated rendering in web views"
5. Safely exit steam and start from the icon outside of terminal to test
